Here's a link to a google colab notebook with the reservoir computing in tensorflow code: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://githubtocolab.com/awikner/CHyPP/blob/master/TREND_Logistic_Regression.ipynb)

Here's an example of python code formatted on Github Pages!
```python
def hello_world():
    print('Hello World!')
```
