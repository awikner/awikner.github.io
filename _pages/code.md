Here's a link to a google colab notebook with the reservoir computing in tensorflow code: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://githubtocolab.com/awikner/awikner.github.io/blob/master/_src/reservoir_tensorflow.ipynb)

Here's an example of python code formatted on using a Mardown code block:
```python
def hello_world():
    print('Hello World!')
```

And here is an example of the same code as an embedded Github gist:
